Source files for fixed web pages, particularly documentation
and explanatory content.

The concept is to write this documentation in markdown
and render to HTML here. To the html-rendered files visible, 
move them over to the ../www-resources directory.

See the Makefile for how this works. In general, you can edit
the source *.md file, and "make install".
