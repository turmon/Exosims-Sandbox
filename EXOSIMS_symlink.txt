The preferred way to name an EXOSIMS version for runs is to
use a Python virtual environment ("venv"), rather than using
the EXOSIMS symlink here.

See ../Python-venvs for more, or in particular:
/proj/exep/rhonda/Sandbox/Python-venvs/README.txt

Rhonda is maintaining the JPL-local EXOSIMS fork:

  /proj/exep/rhonda/exosimsRhonda/EXOSIMS

The EXOSIMS symlink was updated on April 30, 2021 to point to the above 
directory.

The long standing symlink for EXOSIMS pointed to:

  /proj/exep/rhonda/exosims_1.4Walker/EXOSIMS

Walker's fork was officially merged into master in April 2021.
As Walker is no longer available, the above directory is being retired.
