The preferred way to name an EXOSIMS version is to
use a Python virtual environment ("venv"), rather than using
the EXOSIMS symlink (formerly) resident here.

See ../Python-venvs for more, or in particular:
/proj/exep/rhonda/Sandbox/Python-venvs/README.txt

Thus the EXOSIMS symlink has been removed to reduce version confusion.
With this link present, "import EXOSIMS" from this directory could
import from the very old version here.

Updated to add: Many script files use and EZ_dist that refers to the
Sandbox EXOSIMS, so these files (only) were put in place.

Rhonda is maintaining the JPL-local EXOSIMS fork:

  /proj/exep/rhonda/exosimsRhonda/EXOSIMS

The EXOSIMS symlink was updated on April 30, 2021 to point to the above 
directory.

The long standing symlink for EXOSIMS pointed to:

  /proj/exep/rhonda/exosims_1.4Walker/EXOSIMS

Walker's fork was officially merged into master in April 2021.
As Walker is no longer available, the above directory is being retired.
