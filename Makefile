# Makefile for EXOSIMS data reduction and plot generation.
#
# Usage:
#    $ make [ -B ] S=SCENARIO TARGET
#    $ make TARGET
# where TARGET is one of the below.
#
# * make -B forces the action, e.g., when the plot code changes.
# * The S=SCENARIO argument is required for data reduction, plots, and html
#   SCENARIO is the base name of the relevant script file, e.g., for
#   Scripts/HabEx_4m_TS_20180201.json, use S=HabEx_4m_TS_20180201
# * Alternately: set S to the json script, or the sim directory, so that
#   shell filename completion can fill in the name.
# * Simulations are added by the `add-sim.sh' command, separate from "make".
#
# Targets:
# (1) Data reduction and plotting
#   All these targets require a scenario name.
#   reduce:        reduce DRMs to tabulated CSV files for later plotting
#   graphics:      make detections-vs-time plots, and radius-luminosity bar plots.
#   html:          re-generate the index.html that summarizes the given scenario
#   html-only:     same as html, but do not re-reduce the data or remake graphics.
#   path-ensemble: make lon/lat plots of slews taken by an ensemble.
#   star-visit:    per-star tabulation of successful detection visits
#   path-movie-N:  make "N" path-movies and final frames 
#   path-final-N:  make "N" final frames, only
#   obs-timeline-N:make "N" observing-target timelines
#   keepout-N:     make "N" keepout-vs-time plots
#     (above targets make graphics for N arbitrary sims from the scenario, 
#      N = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, or T, where T=all)
#   tar-log:       replace scenario/log with its "tar" archive to save space
#   status:        list the current contents of DRMs for this scenario (like "ls")
# (2) Multi-script reduction and plotting
#   Note, all these targets require an *experiment* name.
#   exp-reduce:      makes "reduce" for all ensembles within the experiment
#   exp-html-top-N:  makes html (inc. graphics) for the N top (by yield) ensembles
#   exp-html-mix-N:  makes html (inc. graphics) for N selected-arbitrarily ensembles
#   exp-html:        makes html for 10 top + 20 selected ensembles - can use make -j2
#   exp-path-ensemble* \   Same pattern as html above with -mix or -top, and a
#   exp-graphics*       \  number saying how many.  Also, can leave off -top-N
#   exp-html-only*      /  and just make 10 top + 20 selected.
#   exp-movie-M-*      /   Make M movies in each of (top/mix)-N ensembles.
#   exp-obs-timeline-M-*   Make M obs-timelines in each of (top/mix)-N ensembles.
# (3) Web-server
#   html-ensure: start Apache httpd web-server, if not running already
#   html-start: start Apache httpd web-server
#   html-stop: stop Apache httpd web-server
#   html-status: show running web-servers, if any
