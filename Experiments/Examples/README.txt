Templating and Experiments
--------------------------

A "basic" example of script templating:
* Sweep_det_202508.exp: with python and a for loop -- a good current example


Plus, two older examples of script templating
* SNR_Rs-2022-06: with shell scripts, and with json-xform.py

* coeff-2023-08-04: with json-xform.py

Still could use:
* A recent dakota example with dprepro
